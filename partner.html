        <h1 class="title"><strong>Partnership Information</strong></h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Your server must meet these requirements to become partnered. <em>CEO exceptions may be made.</em></h2>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Member Requirement</strong></p>
          <p>
            You must have at least <strong><em>50 members</em></strong> in your Discord server. If you have another form of social medium, staff will judge based on that.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Server Requirement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Servers based on the following content will not be accepted into the partnership program:
            These include, but are not limited to:
            <br/>- NSFW imagery (pornography, hentai, CP, etc.)
            <br/>- illegal activity (anything illegal in the United States or United Kingdom)
            <br/>- threats (DDoS threats, death threats, etc.)
            <br/>- Servers dedicated to spamming
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Drama Requirement</strong></p>
          <p>We try to keep Netsky a nice place for everyone to hang out and chat.
            This includes drama and arguments.
            If your server is causing or involved with lots of drama, we will not partner until this drama is resolved.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>User Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            You must be a well known member of our community to become a partner.
            We do not accept partnerships from members joined less than one month ago.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Server Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            As we promote creativity, we are fairly lenient with the appearance of your server.
            However, we do have a few requirements. Your server must have:
            <br/>- an established logo and/or branding. (don't  change the logo's design every day)
            <br/>- an established name
            <br/>- an established staff team
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>
          <p>
            While there are many rules to becoming a partner, exceptions can be made.
            If requested, a member of management can join the server and review it.
            If we find the server breaks a minor policy, we may allow it.
            We cannot promise anything regarding exceptions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
          <p>
            Good luck, future partners!
          </p>
